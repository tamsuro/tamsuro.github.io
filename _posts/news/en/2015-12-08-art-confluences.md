__Carina Qvick-Kansanaho__ comes from Kangasala, Finland. She has been painting as a hobby for 30 years now. She started to paint with oil colours in 1985, when she joined and oil painting course in Kangasalo Opisto. She has bee n an on/off painter for years with some very intensive periods versus long times-even years-of total ‘silence’, without holding a brush in her hand. With watercolours she started at the beginning of 2000’s  on a weekend course  in Kangasala, inspired by a great water colour artist Mirja Pulkkila, who was teaching there. She likes to capture the feeling of a moment, trying to combine the idea and the object. She is also interested in trying to make the light and shadow visible. She has taken part in fe spring exhibitions of Kangasala Main Library together with her ex-colleague in 2006.
