Our restaurant offers a small assortment of traditional Romanian dishes. Our grill will be sizzling with delicious “mici” meat rolls which will be served in a genuine Romanian way with bread and mustard. Other delicacies that we have included in our selection from the Romanian kitchen are scrumptious aubergine salad and soft bean paste. In addition, our small street restaurant will serve delicious desserts, coffee and juice. Face painting and activities for kids free of charge! Welcome to a culinary journey into the land of luscious green valleys and count Dracula in the company of Tampereen Suomi-Romania Association!
