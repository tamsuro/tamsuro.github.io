Passports, borders... they are just a moot point for us.

We offer good reasons and a place for people to meet, plan, do things together and learn about one another. Our aim is to develop an environment where people feel good and experience each other's similarities and differences, whether they are Finnish, Romanian or from somewhere else in the world.
